**CaDC Fiscal Year 2020-2021 Common Scope of Analytics**

This document summarizes the California Data Collaborative (CaDC) scope
of work for the fiscal year 2020-21. This coming year will continue to
build on progress made since the founding of the CaDC in January 2016.
In these three years, the project has established a firm organizational
foundation that supports continued growth and development.

The foundation of the CaDC is discussed below to emphasize a baseline
level of services provided with every CaDC membership. The FY 20-21
scope of work thus includes work required to operate and maintain the
foundational services described below as well as work required to
provide new benefits and improve on existing offerings.

The foundation of the CaDC includes:

  - > A governance structure centered on a Steering Committee composed
    > of representatives of each CaDC member agency. The Steering
    > Committee meets quarterly and sets the overall direction for the
    > CaDC and has final say over the organization’s actions.

  - > Active working groups - known as “Data Action Teams” - focused on
    > subject areas such as water use efficiency, finance, and business
    > development. These Data Action Teams form the on-the-ground heart
    > of the CaDC where analytical tools and other work products are
    > designed and tested.

  - > Dedicated project staff with expertise in software development and
    > applied analytical problem solving. CaDC staff operate and
    > maintain data infrastructure, develop and deploy analytical tools,
    > and engage in direct problem-solving sessions tailored to the
    > needs of each agency.

  - > State-of-the-art data platform for the integration of metered
    > water use and rebate participation data. Agency data is pulled
    > into the CaDC data platform where it is standardized and enriched
    > with additional context like evapotranspiration and demographic
    > data from the American Community Survey.

  - > Software tools to inform planning and analysis. CaDC tools make
    > use of agency and external data to assist staff with tasks like
    > understanding water efficiency in their service area, analyzing
    > the water savings of water efficiency rebates, and forecasting the
    > impact of water rate changes.

  - > Unique inter-agency database of cleaned and standardized metered
    > water use and rebate participation data. These data allow
    > researchers from world class institutions to advance the state of
    > knowledge in the water industry. The scope and diversity of CaDC
    > membership makes this a particularly effective data set for
    > investigating issues like pricing, messaging, and the
    > effectiveness of water efficiency programs.

In addition to the foundational work of the CaDC listed above, specific
projects are selected by the membership each year as priority focus
areas. This year’s scope of work continues the primary focus areas from
the previous year:

1.  > Streamlining statewide data reporting

2.  > Applied research partnerships

3.  > Empowering management decisions with CaDC analytical tools

The first of these is a newer focus area that has increased in
importance alongside the administrative burden placed on local agencies
by regulatory bodies. The other two were chosen as focus areas in order
to capitalize on previous investments and increase effectiveness in two
of the CaDC’s core competencies.

**Streamlining Statewide Data Reporting**

During FY 19-20, the CaDC conducted interviews with staff from both
local and state agencies to gain a deeper understanding of the current
system of water data reporting, including elicitation of the limitations
of the current reporting system. These limitation have been outlined in
a draft whitepaper “A Human-Centered Approach to Streamline Water Data
Reporting

in California” alongside recommendations for how to move the reporting
ecosystem forward to achieve better outcomes for all stakeholders.

In FY20-21, the CaDC will continue to advance the interests of its
members for streamlined reporting by building on the work in the
previous year. The most ambitious path outlined in the whitepaper is for
the creation of a new reporting platform to centralize data submission
related to urban supply and demand. While the creation of this platform
is outside this scope of work, the CaDC will pursue outside funding from
foundation, state, and federal sources to enable the design and
development needed to realize this vision. The CaDC will also continue
to serve as technical advisors for efforts to streamline reporting by
leveraging our technology, design, and domain expertise, including by
participating in state working groups and contributing to work led by
other nonprofit water industry organizations.

The CaDC will explore options to integrate landscape area data gathered
by the state as part of SB606 & AB1668 into CaDC Analytics, as well as
supporting CaDC members with understanding and using the data for their
service area.

In addition to state reporting, the CaDC will also continue to develop
ways to streamline the sharing of secure, anonymized data from retailers
to wholesalers. This is discussed further below.

Specific items include:

1.  > Continue user research to understand the current ecosystem for
    > reporting to the state.

2.  > Pursue external funding to develop a platform to streamline water
    > data reporting.

3.  > Integrate landscape area data gathered by the state as part of
    > SB606 & AB1668 into CaDC Analytics and support CaDC members with
    > understanding and using the data.

4.  > Expand CaDC analytics to facilitate reporting of data between
    > retailers and wholesalers.

5.  > Leverage CaDC technical expertise by participating in state
    > workshops for data streamlining

6.  > Raising awareness and increasing participation in the effort to
    > streamline reporting among stakeholders statewide.

*Estimated CaDC staff time involved:*

  - > Project Manager: 100 hours to research user needs and current
    > practices, apply for funding, coordinate project stakeholders, and
    > contribute to ongoing conversations.

**Applied Research Partnerships**

Facilitating applied research and data sharing has been central to the
CaDC vision since the project’s inception. CaDC staff propose to
continue and build off this work in a number of ways.

Foremost among these will be pursuing the creation of pre-qualified
research centers with simplified access to the CaDC data warehouse.
These centers will be chosen for their high-quality research and
dedication to data privacy. One of the requirements for
pre-qualification will be adherence to a process of review and approval
called the “CaDC Research Data Sharing Protocol” to be determined by the
Steering Committee.

Specific items include

1.  > Support of ongoing research efforts including

2.  > Expanding on the CaDC’s current data sharing framework to simplify
    > the approval process for pre-qualified researchers and research
    > centers.

3.  > Continue development of new and existing research partnerships.

4.  > Promotion of CaDC research among the local and regional agencies
    > to generate interest and increase the value of CaDC research.

*Estimated CaDC staff time involved:*

  - > Project Manager: 100 hours to establish research partnerships and
    > promote research.

  - > Data Scientist: 100 hours to assist researchers with data exports
    > and improve the usability and security of the CaDC data warehouse
    > for researchers.

  - > Interns / Research Fellow: Hours to be determined as research
    > opportunities unfold.

**Empowering management decisions with the CaDC's analytical tools**

Analytical tool development is a core competency of the CaDC and our
tools continue to improve by integrating feedback from the CaDC members.
In FY20-21, we will continue our agile development process to maximize
the usability of our software though frequent user testing and rapid
iteration. This agile process will determine the exact features that are
implemented, though several areas have risen up as a high priority for
future development.

First is the expansion of analytics offerings for wholesale agencies.
Our goal is to streamline the sharing of aggregated, anonymized retail
water use data with wholesale agencies to support informed planning.
Second is the addition of improved intelligence features that identify
relevant customer segments and insights without requiring detailed
processing. Detailed filtering and segmentation will still be available
for advanced users, but our goal is to simplify access to the most
essential insights. Third, will be improved support for “self-service”
analysis for advanced users. One implementation of this might be to
allow users to build their own dashboards on top of cleaned, enriched
CaDC data within a high-performance database.

Further work to improve the overall user experience will focus on
decreasing loading times, updating users on the status of their data
imports, and otherwise working to build user trust in the results of
analysis.

Specific items include

1.  > Improve support for wholesale analytics and data sharing.

2.  > Simplify user interface with enhanced intelligence to identify
    > relevant customer segments without extensive user effort.

3.  > Enhance support for “self-service” dashboard creation and
    > analytics.

4.  > Continue integration between different cadc tools for a more
    > unified and intuitive user experience.

*Estimated CaDC staff time involved:*

  - > Project Manager: 40 hours per month overseeing product
    > development, conducting code review, testing new features, and
    > supporting development.

  - > Data Scientist: 80 hours per month developing product and
    > maintaining data pipelines.

  - > Designer: 40 hours per month creating designs, interviewing users
    > and testing mockups
